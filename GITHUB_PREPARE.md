Preparing this repository for GitHub

This repository is ready to be uploaded to GitHub. The repository already contains model checkpoints (e.g. `training/runs/best.pt`) which are large binary files and should not be tracked in regular Git history. Below are the changes added to help with the upload and CI:

- Added `.gitignore` to exclude caches, virtualenvs and model weights.
- Added `.gitattributes` to mark model weights for Git LFS.
- Added an `MIT` `LICENSE`.
- Added a GitHub Actions workflow to run tests on push/PR (`.github/workflows/python-package.yml`).

Quick steps to publish (Windows `cmd.exe`):

```cmd
cd \path\to\this\repo
git init
git lfs install
git add .gitattributes
git add .
git commit -m "chore: initial import â€” add gitignore, gitattributes, CI, license"
git remote add origin <your-github-remote-url>
git push -u origin main
```

Notes and recommendations:
- Use `git lfs` for model weights. After `git lfs install` and committing `.gitattributes`, re-add any large files you want to track with LFS and commit those separately (or upload them outside git and keep only download scripts in the repo).
- The CI installs dependencies from `training/requirements.txt` and `precursor_regression/requirements.txt` when present, and runs `pytest`.
- If you want me to remove the existing `training/runs/best.pt` from local git history (or move it into LFS), I can provide an automated sequence of commands or modify the repo to use LFS for that file.

If you'd like, I can now:
- Commit these preparatory files for you (if you want the exact commit message and remote configured here),
- Convert the existing `training/runs/best.pt` to be tracked by Git LFS and remove it from git history, or
- Create a small release script / .gitattributes tweak and README notes for downloading pre-trained weights from an external storage (recommended for large models).
